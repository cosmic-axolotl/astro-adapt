## First take

| Profile | Age Range | Education | Needs | Adaptation Strategy |
|----------|------------|------------|--------|----------------------|
| Child | 6â€“12 | Elementary | Visual learning, narration | Use metaphors, animations |
| Teen | 13â€“18 | Middle/High school | Interactive and concise | Mix of visuals and text |
| Adult (basic) | 30â€“60 | High school | Simple language | Avoid jargon |
| Adult (advanced) | 18+ | University | Technical accuracy | Use formulas, sources |

Is expected, in the future, to have mixed and more refined profiles. Ones formation should imply in a more criterial text, e.g. if the person has academic formation in physics, the text will be more technical

## Accessibility Notes
- Implement voice narration and adjustable font size.
