# astro-adapt
a fully adaptable website, which main focus will be on popularizing science (mainly astronomy)

# 🌌 Adaptive Astronomy Website

A **scientific outreach project** designed to make astronomy accessible to everyone — regardless of age, education level, or background.  

The website automatically adapts its **content, language style, and examples** based on user responses to a short initial questionnaire.  
The goal is to create a **personalized, inclusive learning experience** that helps people understand astronomy in a way that fits their reality.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Make astronomy **accessible and engaging** for diverse audiences.  
- Implement **dynamic content adaptation** based on user profiles.  
- Design a **responsive and adaptive interface** for all devices.  
- In future updates, include **accessibility features** (screen reader support, contrast modes, sign language, etc.).

## 🛠️ Technologies (still to be defined, but at first some, or all, of these

| Area | Tools |
|------|-------|
| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap or Tailwind |
| **Backend** | Python (Flask / FastAPI) or Node.js |
| **Database** | SQLite / PostgreSQL |
| **Version Control** | Git + GitHub |
| **Design & UX** | Canva / Procreate / Photoshop (mockups and visuals) |

## 🔄 How It Works

1. The user answers a **short questionnaire** (age and education level).  
2. The system identifies the most suitable **reading profile**.  
3. The website dynamically displays **adapted content** — with simplified explanations, examples, and visuals.  
4. In future releases, users will be able to choose **thematic modules** (e.g., stars, planets, galaxies, etc.).

## 🌠 Roadmap

- [ ] Define overall architecture (frontend + backend).  
- [ ] Build database of adaptive astronomy texts.  
- [ ] Implement questionnaire and dynamic routing.  
- [ ] Add accessibility and assistive features.  
- [ ] Deploy a **beta version** on GitHub Pages or Render.
